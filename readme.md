# Introduction

IDAO (working name) is envisioned as an ideologically-based variant of a [decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization). IDAO might be best described as a virtual/online nation, founded on basic principles of social responsibility and reason. The primary asset and output of IDAO is a set of online properties, collectively referred to as our technology platform.

IDAO members are referred to as citizens and must accept and adhere to the IDAO organizing principles in order to maintain citizenship. IDAO citizens are able to vote on initiatives, policies and online platform features using a simple online, majority rules system.

IDAO citizens are united by their rejection of the current and evolving state of politics and societal norms, both in the United States and elsewhere. Rather than simply complaining and fretting about the rise of nationalism, intolerance and irrationality, we are channeling our energy towards establishing and growing our virtual nation of like-minded individuals.

IDAO is not directly affiliated with a particular political party, nor is it intentionally left or right politically. Ideally, IDAO citizens will span the spectrum of political affiliations, leaving a great deal of room for differences on a range of public policy topics while agreeing on a basic set of principles.

# Organizing Principles

> This is an initial set of principles that need to be further refined. The founding contributors will do this initially, followed by a process wherein all citizens can vote on the addition or amendment to this list.

We believe that certain truths are self-evident and beyond rational debate. These are as follows.

1. The rise of [nationalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism) and [fascism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) is a threat to civil society.
2. Systemic [racism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism) exists and must be dismantled.
3. Policing must be reformed to prioritize conflict resolution over the application of physical force.
4. [LGBTQ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/LGBTQ) rights are inseparable from [human rights](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/human%20rights).
5. Basic health care is a fundamental human right.
6. [Capitalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism) is an effective and generally beneficial economic model but must be constrained to avoid radical inequality and exploitation.
7. Private gun ownership, where legal, should be considered a privilege rather than a right.
8. [Climate change](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/climate%20change) is real and caused by human activity.
9. Vaccinations are an example of successful public health policy.

All platform services will enable users to mark individual and company accounts as possibly offending the organizing principals. A special team of paid reviewers will assess the claims and, if warranted, will create a proposal for reprimanding or blocking the offender. The proposal will be voted on as with any other proposal and the citizens will decide if action should be taken or not.

# Economics

The economics underlying IDAO are common to many DAO efforts. Additionally, accommodation must be made to incentivize early contributors, without whom the effort will never materialize.

## Founding Contributors

Before the initial fund raise event is completed and before the voting system is enabled, an initial core group of founding contributors will be organized. This team will shape the early IDAO concept and implementation until the voting system is in place and a user base sufficient to produce a reasonable quorum exists.

Early contributors (before the initial NFT fund-raise) will be incentivized in two ways:

1. Unique badges (see below section on badges) that are not available on an exchange and are customized to the person.
2. Grant of IDAO coin coinciding with ICO (or appropriate equivalent).

All contributors - including founding contributors - will receive payment for their efforts following a successful fundraising event. The exact mechanism for this, including hourly rates, will be sorted out once the fundraise is complete.

## Crowdfunding

The initial marketing campaign will include an IDAO website that explains the concepts and also provides an input form for users to register for email updates on progress. There will also be a link provided to allow users to contribute monetarily to the effort via a crowdfunding web site.

## Badges (NFT's)

NFT's will be used for a secondary fundraise (following crowdfunding). These will take the form of an IDAO "Badge".

A badge is an NFT that is part of a "series". Each series includes a limited number of themed NFT's that are part of it. The series imparts privileges associated with the badge but it is also a status symbol that is visible when the user takes part in platform services.

Additionally, each series has a cryptocurrency value associated with it. Following the initial [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering), each badge holder will receive a IDAO coin grant in an amount associated with the series.

## Cryptocurrency

As mentioned throughout this document, an IDAO cryptocurrency will be minted and made available via an ICO or similar mechanism at some point following the initial crowdsourcing and NFT-driven fundraising rounds. These will be true utility tokens and can be used for exchanging goods and services on the platform.

There will be a permanent, fixed number of coins/tokens minted as part of the ICO and this number will never be increased.

Eventually, the tokens may be made available via an exchange such as Coinbase where they can be bought and sold by anyone. This decision will likely be made via a citizen vote.

# Platform Services

As true Web3, decentralized applications, all IDAO online services have the following characteristics:

* **Resilient**

Since the software and data are spread across many computer nodes around the planet using blockchain technology (not on AWS for instance), no one entity can disrupt - intentionally or otherwise - the service. Likewise, the services can never be compromised or censored.

* **Private**

Citizen identity and any content they create belongs to citizens and cannot be used to track them or for the generation of ad content.

* **Decentralized**

There is no "company" that benefits from content citizens create so any value that is created is shared with citizens in the from of IDAO cryptocurrency.

The following subsections outline an initial, envisioned collection of platform applications. Over time this list will grow and the functionality will expand.

## Voting System

The voting system consists of two basic sub-components as follows:

* **Proposition Creation & Management**

IDAO Citizens vote on propositions. A proposition is a written description of an initiative, change or enhancement associated with the technology platform itself or virtually any other IDAO activity. The platform will provide a service that allows any citizen to create a proposition. Once created, citizens are free to comment on the proposition and to campaign for support. In order for a proposition to be made available for voting, it must reach a minimum level of initial support (exact criterion TBD).

* **Proposition Voting**

Once a proposition has achieved the minimum required level of community support, it will be put up for a general vote. Each votable proposition will have a voting time window (initially 30 days). Propositions are passed by a simple majority and will be prioritized by the IDAO development team thereafter.

## Dating App

This online service will include characteristics common to existing, centralized services such as eHarmony. Users will be able to view profiles of singles in their area.

## Buy & Sell Locally

This online service will include characteristics common to existing, centralized services such as OfferUp, NextDoor and others. Users will be able to post items for sale and allow buyers to purchase them using IDAO coin.

## Find & Rate Local Businesses

This online service will include characteristics common to existing, centralized services such as Yelp. Users will be able to find local merchants (restaurants, nail salons, etc.) that are themselves IDAO citizens/participants. A rating system will be provided as well as an ability to leave comments.

Users will receive IDAO coin for rating and/or comments.

Merchants will be able to control page positioning and possibly apply other enhanced formatting of their company information using IDAO coin.

## Coupon and Discount Finder

This online service will include characteristics common to existing, centralized services such as GroupOn. Participating merchants will accept IDAO coin in exchange for discounts and special offers. This coin can then be used by the merchants to pay for advertising on the social media hub and other locations (without using user-specific data).

## Employment Service

IDAO citizens can locate jobs with employers that are also citizens.

Additionally, employers can find employees that are IDAO citizens.

## Host Country/Region Compatibility Matrix

The platform will assess and continually update the status of countries and regions in terms of their relative compatibility with our organizing principals. Additionally, for countries or regions where the compatibility index is especially high, we will provide relocation information and guidance.

# Propagation

An initial, working assumption is that traditional social media market channels (Facebook, Google Ads, etc.) will not be available due to the ideological nature of IDAO. Therefore we must find alternative channels, likely relying heavily on social media influencers.

## Branding

The eventual public name and brand presence for IDAO is going to be a crucial aspect of the early marketing efforts. The name must communicate something essential about what IDAO is (and is not). It also must facilitate the over theme of building a new country.

## Ambassadors

The initial primary outreach, fundraising and community-building activities will be performed by IDAO Ambassadors.

IDAO Ambassadors will be assigned specific target groups likely to be receptive to the IDAO mission and philosophy.

Ambassadors may be incentivized with unique badges and/or IDAO coin (TBD).

Target groups may include the following:

* Health & Wellness Community
* Cannabis Industry
* Environmental Groups
* Animal Rights Groups
* Sustainability Groups
* Immigrant Rights Groups

# Roadmap

The founding contributors will define and manage a set of initial platform milestones. After these milestones are completed, the platform will be able to support the envisioned proposal and community voting process. All subsequent milestones and features will be managed through this voting system.

## Milestone 0: Validation

This is the first milestone and is intended to validate the IDAO concept and our ability to market it.

The milestone has the following, high-level goals:

* IDAO website launched
* Prospective citizens can sign up for updates on platform availability via email
* Crowdfunding site set up

This milestone will be complete when 1k users have signed up and US5K has been raised via the crowdfunding site.

## Milestone 1: Launch

The purpose of this milestone is to launch the first version of the web portal along with NFT purchasing.

The milestone has the following, high-level goals:
